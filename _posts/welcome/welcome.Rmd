</center>

Streaming online social media can be used to study crime detection problems. Combining geospatial information and suspicious social media post can help prevent and track the potential crimes, which has been widely used in many institutions. In this project, we will explore the microblogs data from 2021 IEEE VAST Challenge [Mini-Challenge 3](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2021/MC3.html) to evaluate the risks to the public and recommend actions to local law enforcement. In addition, we plan to further analyze past events from historical news reports in [Mini-Challenge 1](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2021/MC1.html) to determine frequent occurring locations that were subjected to chaos or accidents. This will allow us to better evaluate the risks of any incidents that might occur at those hotspots over time.


# Project Objectives


![VAST Challenge 2021 - Overview](images/vastchallenge.png)


For this project, we will be using **both text and visual analytics approach** to analyze the available data and develop responses to the questions in VAST Challenge 2021 Mini-Challenge 3. We wish to understand ongoing incident text transcripts of emergency dispatches by the Abila, Kronos local police and fire departments, as well as local responses via the Micro blog. We will use interactive **R Shiny** dashboard to visualize real-time streaming social media data and geospatial data to make recommendations for further investigation.


# Datasets 

|No | Dataset | Information |
|:-:|:-----:|:-------------|
|1| Aliba.shp | Aliba geospatial map file with geometry information including longitude, latitude and location names.|
|2| csv-1700-1830, <br/>csv-1831-2000, <br/> csv-2001-2131 | Call Center and Blog information during time period from 1700 to 2131 Abila time on January 23,2014, with 5 variables - date, author, message, hotspot location, latitude and longitude |
|3| News Articles | Historical news reports on past events that consists of detailed documentation, timeline and location of events occurring.|


# Proposed Scope and Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

As the data given is unstructured, we will perform text pre-processing techniques to filter out and re-organize the textual data based on null values, manipulation of strings (lowercase, symbols, numbers), tokenization and stemming. This is to ensure all textual data are standardized for easier analysis.


### 2. Understanding Historical News Reports and Microblog Data

We will first provide **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Time-series Analysis** by basic statistical and world cloud visualization, which will provide a overview of content being discussed in microblog/call center, and help to highlight past events that occurred at certain areas, which we will be able to relate to real-time monitoring.

Additionally, we will then perform **Topic Modeling** techniques by Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to understand topics generated from text data. These topics are words that can be in the form of unigram. To analysis the modeling results, user can select top n words to discover topics, understand topic distribution during the time period in the community and user engagement of each topic.

Then,a **Network Analysis** will be performed based on the re-tweet relationship between users to discover influential authors and unimportant users. We will also analysis the degree of the network and its distribution to help users explore and identify social relationships, interactions, and communications 

Moreover, we plan to apply visualization techiniques of **Hexagon Binning Map** discussed in research paper (Kam,BARSHIKAR,TAN 2012) to show real-time location-stamped text distribution in the community. By applying color with gradient, users can quickly locate the hexagon districts with the most number of posts and subsequently estimate the risk level in specific areas.


### 3. Storyboard & Visualizations for R Shiny

### 4. Visualizing from combination of Texts and Geospatial

As we wish to further visualize how the call center, microblog and historical news reports relate, our approach will be split into 3 parts: one for geospatial mapping with words, the other solely on text analysis and lastly some exploratory analysis.

- In the **first storyboard**, we would like to determine how the hotspots’ location received by the call center are aligned with the top trending word(s) posted via social media (mapped using geospatial data). Filters will also be added to display the hotspots’ location and trending words during the selected sync-ed timeframe. From here, we can determine if the call received by the call center is (1) a false alarm or (2) an actual emergency happening. 

- In the **second plot**, we wish to analyze the authenticity, main topics and sentiment posted by each author. This will allow us to detect any weird activity as well as identify possible suspicious person. Text analytics techniques such as topic modeling (displaying about top 10 topics generated) as well as sentiment analysis (generated with word cloud) will be used to investigate the posts. Filters including author names as well as number of words to be shown will be added to facilitate the visualization.

- Lastly, the **third storyboard** represents the exploratory and time-series analysis of the real-time topic words. We can also filter by time to show the depth of analysis, as well as filtering by authors. This will allow us to detect top trending topics based on the author and highlight any suspicious activity that can be flagged for the emergency dispatchers.
